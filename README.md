# World of Porkcraft
This guide is designed to help you install, configure and connect to the private World of Porkcraft: Wrath of the Lich King server. Keeping all this documentation on Discord was convenient, however it wasn't easy for new players. Please note this is not a server that is open the public, and you must have an account created for you by the server's administrator.

## Installation
1. Download the [ChromieCraft 3.3.5a](https://www.chromiecraft.com/en/downloads/) client for your operating system.
2. Extract the contents of zip file on your computer.
> [!TIP]
> If you don't have the retail version of World of Warcraft, you can install the contents of that zip here: `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\`.

## Configuration
Now we'll need to configure your client to connect to the Porkcraft server.
1. Open the installation folder you created for the game.
2. Navigate to `...\Data\enUS\realmlist.wtf`.
3. If it's not present you may need to create this file.
4. Open realmlist.wtf with a text editor (like notepad) and add the following: `set realmlist porkchopexpress.servebeer.com`.
5. Save the file and close it.

- Raid bots have a suffix in their name that denotes their role.

    - botnameHLR is a Healer
- Feel free to bring the bots when questing or running dungeons
